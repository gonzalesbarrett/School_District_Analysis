# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze key metrics for a specific school district. The request is to provide the key metrics in a presentable table format. The primary asks include:

- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
- The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
- School performance based on the budget per student
- School performance based on the school size 
- School performance based on the type of school

We are tasked with ensuring the data is clean and correct. However, the initial data is later determined to have some significant anomolies related to the 9th grade students at Thomas High School. After our initial summary of the data we were required to recontruct our tables and remove the offending parties.
We will show below the impact the metrics had when accounting for & removing the potential fraudulent data.
